# Email-LinkedIn-Automation-Tool
This automation tool is a website that connects to the Google Cloud Console and automatically sends out emails to contacts in a CSV file. The tool also formats LinkedIn profile links, assumed to be in the CSV, in an organized format to make it easier to manually send out connection requests.
